### Text Editor with AutoComplete
  Developed for COMP 128, this sophisticated Java-based text editor offers advanced functionalities akin to Google Docs and Microsoft Word, utilizing Java Swing for its user interface. It includes real-time word autocomplete, powered by a custom PrefixTree for efficient word suggestions, and dynamic text formatting within a JTextPane. The editor supports extensive text formatting options, file management capabilities (open, edit, save), and an advanced undo/redo feature via a sized stack mechanism. Additionally, scheduled tasks ensure automatic backup of text changes, showcasing the application of advanced Java concepts such as concurrency and scheduled execution. This project not only enhances typing efficiency through its AutoComplete function but also demonstrates practical applications of Data Structures within Java programming.
